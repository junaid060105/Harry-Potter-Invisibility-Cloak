# Harry Potter Invisible Cloak 🪄🧙‍♂️

This project uses OpenCV to create the "invisible cloak" effect inspired by Harry Potter.  
By detecting a specific cloak color (e.g., red/blue/green) and replacing it with the background, the cloak blends into the surroundings, making the person appear invisible.

## Features
- Real-time webcam capture
- Color detection using HSV masks
- Background replacement to simulate invisibility
- Simple and fun computer vision project

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Usage
1.Run the background.py file and click and an image of the background.
2.Run invisible_cloak.py and do the magic.
